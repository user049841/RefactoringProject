# Project Details
The initial project was a dungeon exploring game with a few different enemies, items, and a goal to reach the exit.
Various refactors were done including:
  - Making the enemies, items, and goals more extensible
  - Using design patterns such as strategy pattern instead of duplicating code.
  - Creating new enemies, items, and goals.
  - Adding a simple combination system where items could be combined to form other ones.
Tests were written for each new feature, available in src/test/java/.
